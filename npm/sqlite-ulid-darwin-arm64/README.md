# sqlite-ulid-darwin-arm64

A `sqlite-ulid` platform-specific package for `darwin-arm64`. 

When `sqlite-ulid` is installed and the host computer has a `darwin` operating system with `arm64` architecture, then this package is downloaded with the pre-compiled SQLite extension bundled under `lib/ulid0.dylib`. At runtime, the `sqlite-ulid` package will resolve to this platform-specific package for use with [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3)' or [`node-sqlite3`](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3).

See the `sqlite-ulid` package for more details.
